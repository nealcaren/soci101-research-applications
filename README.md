# SOCI 101: Sociological Perspectives
## Research Applications

This repository contains ten research-based assignments designed to teach students how sociologists observe, measure, and analyze social patterns. Each assignment combines classical sociological concepts with hands-on research methods.

---

## Overview

**Research Applications** are short, scaffolded assignments where students apply sociological thinking to real-world observations. Each assignment:

- Builds specific research skills (observation, data collection, analysis, interpretation)
- Connects directly to course chapters and concepts
- Offers three difficulty levels: **Basic (75)**, **Proficient (87)**, **Advanced (100)**
- Allows revision and resubmission for grades below the attempted level
- Counts toward 30% of the final course grade

Students complete **10 research applications total** and can drop their **4 lowest grades**. This means each completed RA is worth ~5% of the final grade.

## The Ten Assignments

### **RA01: The Beginner's Mind - An Ethnography of Campus Life**
*Ethnographic observation; social norms and socialization*

Students observe a familiar campus space (dining hall, library, quad) through an outsider's perspective and document invisible social rules, hierarchies, and patterns. Teaches how ordinary social practices are actually complex and rule-governed.

**Methods:** 1-3 observation sessions, field notes, photographs, analysis of patterns
**Concepts:** Social norms, socialization, habitus, symbolic interaction, civil inattention

---

### **RA02: Twenty Statements Test - Identity and Self-Concept**
*Survey research; identity analysis; systematic coding*

Students complete the classic Twenty Statements Test ("Who am I?") and analyze whether their self-concept is group-based or trait-based. At higher levels, they recruit additional participants and compare coding schemes to understand how measurement choices shape findings.

**Methods:** Self-administered survey, categorical coding, comparative analysis
**Concepts:** Identity, self-concept, socialization, social roles, individualism vs. collectivism

---

### **RA03: Breaching Experiment - Uncovering Hidden Norms**
*Ethnomethodology; social interaction; deviance*

Students deliberately violate minor social norms (standing facing backward in an elevator, asking permission for routine favors) and document how people react. Shows that social order depends on shared, unstated understandings that only become visible when broken.

**Methods:** Structured norm violation, field observation, interview (optional), analysis of reactions
**Concepts:** Social norms, deviance, ethnomethodology, social interaction, civil inattention

---

### **RA04: Cultural Capital on Television - Class and Representation**
*Media analysis; cultural capital; class stratification*

Students analyze how television characters display cultural capital—what they read, watch, listen to, eat, how they speak—and connects this to class position. Shows how media both reflects and reproduces class inequalities.

**Methods:** Content analysis of 4-6 episodes, categorization by cultural capital markers
**Concepts:** Cultural capital, class, status, symbolic violence, media representation

---

### **RA05: Algorithmic Bias Audit - Testing AI Fairness**
*Audit study method; algorithmic discrimination; bias in AI*

Students conduct controlled experiments testing whether Large Language Models reproduce documented hiring discrimination based on names that signal gender, class, or ethnicity. They generate candidate bios for matched name pairs, have the LLM compare them, and analyze patterns in bias.

**Methods:** Audit study design, multiple repetitions, pattern documentation, comparative analysis
**Concepts:** Discrimination, algorithmic bias, institutional racism, gender/ethnic stratification, meritocracy

---

### **RA06: The Bechdel Test - Gender in Media**
*Media analysis; feminist film criticism; representation*

Students apply the Bechdel Test and additional metrics to TV shows/films to measure gender representation. Shows how seemingly neutral media choices (scene selection, dialogue, character focus) systematically exclude women's stories and agency.

**Methods:** Content analysis, tallying, comparison across genres/time periods
**Concepts:** Gender inequality, representation, male gaze, intersectionality, media literacy

---

### **RA07: Survey Research on Family Views**
*Survey methodology; family sociology; social change*

Students design and administer short surveys (15-20 responses) asking about family structure attitudes, division of labor, and changing values. Compares contemporary beliefs to historical patterns and peers' responses.

**Methods:** Survey design, sampling, data entry, statistical summary, cross-tabulation
**Concepts:** Family structures, gender roles, social change, values, socialization

---

### **RA08: Media Consumption Diary - Class and Leisure**
*Participant observation (self); consumption patterns; social stratification*

Students track their own media and leisure consumption for 3-14 days, analyzing what activities cost money, require equipment, are public vs. private, digital vs. analog, commodified vs. free. Reveals how leisure choices reflect and reproduce class position.

**Methods:** Daily diary tracking, categorization table, media/consumption analysis
**Concepts:** Cultural capital, commodification, social class, public/private divide, digital divide

---

### **RA09: Alienation in Student Work - Labor and Marxist Analysis**
*Interview research; Marx's alienation theory; labor sociology*

Students interview a peer about their work experience (campus job, service work, gig work) and analyze whether they experience alienation from: the product of their labor, the work process, coworkers, or themselves. Teaches how job structure (not personality) shapes worker experience.

**Methods:** Semi-structured interview (20-30 min), thematic coding, analysis of structural factors
**Concepts:** Alienation, labor, capitalism, bureaucracy, work and identity

---

### **RA10: Leisure Consumption and Social Class**
*Self-observation; stratification; distinction*

Students document their leisure activities over 3-14 days, analyzing how access to certain activities depends on money, time, equipment, and cultural knowledge. Shows how leisure is a key site where class inequality is produced and reproduced.

**Methods:** Diary/photography, categorization by cost/access, comparative analysis
**Concepts:** Cultural capital, social class, consumption, distinction, reproduction of inequality

## Assignment Structure

Each assignment follows this consistent format:

1. **Opening Narrative** - Engages students with a concrete example and poses sociological questions
2. **Skills Section** - Explicitly states 2-3 learning goals (what students will be able to do)
3. **Assignment Overview** - Describes what they'll actually do and how it connects to sociology
4. **Rubric by Level:**
   - **Basic** (250-300 words): Core requirements, simple scope
   - **Proficient** (400-500 words): Intermediate complexity, more data/analysis
   - **Advanced** (600-700 words): Sophisticated analysis, hypothesis testing, comparison
5. **Report Structure** - How to organize their findings (Introduction → Methods → Findings → Conclusion → Appendix)
6. **Grading Note** - Grades are based on clarity, evidence quality, and analytical depth—not on "interesting" subject matter

## Key Pedagogical Features

### Tiered Difficulty (Not Forced)
Students **choose** their level. This reduces anxiety ("Will this count against me if I aim high?") and encourages ambition. Students can always revise upward.

### Scaffolded Instructions
Rather than "do qualitative analysis," we specify:
- *How* to collect data (what counts as a "complete" observation)
- *What* to look for (explicit examples of patterns)
- *How* to code/analyze (step-by-step guidance)
- *Why* it matters (connection to concepts)

### Built-in Reflexivity
Every assignment asks students to reflect on limitations:
- Could they have missed patterns?
- How might their own position have shaped what they noticed?
- What biases or assumptions did they bring?

This teaches that sociology is not about objective "truth" but about transparent, defensible interpretation.

### Multiple Research Methods
Across the ten assignments, students experience:
- Ethnographic observation (RA01, RA08)
- Survey/interview research (RA02, RA07, RA09)
- Content/media analysis (RA04, RA06, RA08)
- Experimental design (RA05)
- Norm violation/ethnomethodology (RA03)
