<p>Interactions are governed by strict unwritten rules. Breaking those
rules reveals what norms are and how people react to violations. Before
beginning, review the “Values, Norms, and Sanctions” section and page
438 (“Encounters with Strangers”) in the textbook, particularly “civil
inattention.”</p>
<p>This exercise develops three essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Observing and analyzing the unwritten rules that govern everyday
interactions</li>
<li>Understanding how people enforce social norms through their
reactions to violations</li>
<li>Recognizing how deviance reveals the underlying structure of social
order</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will conduct a breaching
experiment—an exercise that deliberately violates one or more social
norms—and analyze people’s reactions. You can work alone or in a group
(four or fewer participants), and your breach can be conducted either in
physical spaces or digitally. Through your observations and
documentation, you’ll uncover the invisible rules that structure social
interaction and understand what happens when those rules are broken.
You’ll then write a research report analyzing what your breach revealed
about norms, social control, and human interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical constraints:</strong> The norm violation cannot
include illegal activities or those that might risk someone’s safety,
health, or well-being. Don’t complete breaches where the violation
itself causes someone sadness or anger (e.g., telling a friend they look
ugly). No being mean. <strong>Important:</strong> You may conduct your
breach as part of a group, but each person must perform the breach at
least once and individually write and submit a research report.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>

<h2 id="rubric-assignment-components-by-level">Rubric: Assignment
Components by Level</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-project-overview"><strong>Introduction: Project
Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Explain what norm violations
reveal about social interaction - Describe which norms you decided to
breach and why these were good choices for learning - Note your
expectations: What did you think would happen? How did you predict
people would react?</p>
<h3 id="methods-analytical-roadmap"><strong>Methods: Analytical
Roadmap</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - <strong>Clearly explain which
social norms you violated.</strong> Be specific: What exactly is the
norm? Why is it a norm? How did you violate it? - Describe the
setting(s) where you conducted the breach(es) (physical or digital) -
Explain your selection process: Why did you choose these particular
norms? What made them good choices for investigation? - Describe your
approach to observation and documentation—what did you pay attention
to?</p>
<p><strong>All levels should include:</strong> - Video or photographic
proof of the breach (ideally a link to video; if solo work, a photo pre-
or post-breach is sufficient) - Submit proof via Canvas as part of the
assignment or by texting it to Professor Caren (number on syllabus). In
your report, note how you submitted it.</p>
<p><strong>Ethical requirements (all levels):</strong> - <strong>Respect
the privacy of others.</strong> Do not identify people by name in your
report. Use generic descriptions (e.g., “a stranger,” “a friend,” “a
cashier”) - <strong>Protect emotional safety.</strong> If anyone
expressed genuine discomfort or distress, remove that breach from your
report and explanation. Momentary confusion or awkwardness is expected;
sustained distress, anger, or emotional harm is not. - If conducting
digitally (e.g., in Discord, forums, online games), note the platform
and context</p>
<h3 id="findings-trends-and-significance"><strong>Findings: Trends and
Significance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Note moments where people did
<em>not</em> react, and analyze what silence or avoidance suggests about
the norm.</p>
<p><strong>Basic (250 words minimum):</strong> - Describe which norm(s)
you violated and how - Detail people’s actual reactions (not predicted,
but what really happened) - Describe how you felt during the breach and
reflect on why you felt that way - Create a simple list or table
showing: Norm Violated | People’s Reactions | Your Feelings</p>
<p><strong>Proficient (500 words minimum):</strong> - Describe multiple
breaches (more than one norm, or same norm in different ways) - Use
detailed description to explain people’s varied reactions across
breaches - Build on your emotional reflection by analyzing <em>why</em>
these feelings occurred - Create a table showing: Norm Violated |
Setting | Predicted Reaction | Actual Reaction | Your Feeling - Explain
what your findings mean sociologically (connection to more than one
course concept—bold them, e.g., <strong>civil inattention</strong>,
<strong>deviance</strong>, <strong>sanctions</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced (500+ words minimum):</strong> - Develop and clearly
state your hypothesis before describing breaches (e.g., “Strangers are
more likely to use face-saving behaviors than friends,” or “Online
communities have different norm-violation tolerances than in-person
spaces”) - Describe multiple breaches designed to test your hypothesis -
Create a detailed table showing results: Norm | Context | Hypothesis
Prediction | Actual Result | Analysis - Analyze how the breach might
have differed if a different person conducted it (consider personality,
identity, social position, etc.) - Explain findings in relation to
course concepts (bold them)</p>
<p>You are graded on sociological analysis and evidence—not on how
shocking, funny, or extreme the breach is.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-sociological-synthesis"><strong>Conclusion:
Sociological Synthesis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>In your conclusion:</strong> - Reflect on what your breaches
revealed about social norms and interactions - Connect findings to
course concepts—explain how your observations illustrate or complicate
<strong>theories of deviance</strong>, <strong>social control</strong>,
<strong>norms and sanctions</strong>, or <strong>civil
inattention</strong> - Evaluate your methodology: What are the
limitations? Could others have interpreted reactions differently? What
assumptions did you make? - Discuss any surprises or unexpected
findings</p>
<h3 id="appendix-supplementary-information"><strong>Appendix:
Supplementary Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should include:</strong> - Your video link or
photograph (proving breach occurred) - Your detailed observation notes
from the breach(es) - Any additional photos or evidence documenting the
breach</p>
