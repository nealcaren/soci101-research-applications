<p>How much time do you spend consuming media each day? What are you
really doing when you scroll through social media, watch streaming
shows, or listen to music? Media consumption seems like a personal,
individual choice—what you watch, listen to, and read is entirely up to
you. Yet sociology reveals that our media habits are deeply social:
they’re shaped by our class position, our demographics, our available
time and resources, and the algorithmic systems that decide what we see.
This research application asks you to track your own media consumption
and analyze what it reveals about yourself and society.</p>
<p>This exercise develops four essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Systematically documenting personal behavior and habits</li>
<li>Recognizing patterns in data and understanding what they reveal</li>
<li>Applying sociological theory to everyday practices</li>
<li>Reflecting critically on how individual choices connect to broader
social forces</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will track your media consumption
across multiple platforms and devices for 1-3 days (depending on your
level). You’ll record what you’re consuming, how long you spend, what
device you’re using, and the context. You’ll then organize this data
into visualizations and analyze patterns: When do you consume media?
Which platforms dominate? What’s the balance between active engagement
and passive consumption? Finally, you’ll interpret these patterns
through sociological concepts and reflect on how your individual media
habits reflect broader social trends about leisure, inequality, and
digital culture.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>
<hr />

attempting: “Basic,” “Proficient,” or “Advanced.”</strong> You must
complete all components of that level to earn the grade.</p>
