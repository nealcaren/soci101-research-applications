<h1 id="seeing-the-strange-an-ethnography-of-campus-life">Seeing the
Strange: An Ethnography of Campus Life</h1>
<p>The greatest challenge for a sociologist isn't finding exotic customs
to study - it's seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary. We pass
through our daily routines blind to the complex social choreography
around us, following unwritten rules we've internalized so deeply that
we no longer notice them. This assignment asks you to develop what some
call a “beginner's mind,” approaching familiar spaces and practices as
if encountering them for the first time. Just as Ariel puzzled over
humans using a “dinglehopper” and Buddy the Elf marveled at revolving
doors, you will strip away your accumulated knowledge of campus life.
Your task is to observe common campus spaces and practices with fresh
eyes as if you've never seen anything like them before.</p>
<p>This exercise trains three essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Seeing the strange in the familiar</li>
<li>Documenting social patterns systematically</li>
<li>Analyzing how everyday practices create and maintain social
order</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this ethnographic field assignment, you will select a common
campus location or practice (such as a dining hall during peak hours,
library study spaces, or informal gathering spots) and examine it
through the lens of an outsider. Through careful observation sessions,
document the physical layout, behavioral patterns, and social dynamics
that shape this space. Take detailed field notes describing how people
claim territory, establish hierarchies, and navigate unwritten rules.
Photograph key aspects of the environment. Your analysis should uncover
the invisible social choreography that guides daily campus life, from
seating arrangements and group formations to temporal patterns and
status signals. Present your findings in a research report that includes
your field notes, photographs with analytical captions, and a
theoretical analysis connecting your observations to broader
sociological concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> This assignment is <em>not</em>
about evaluating or judging individuals, but about identifying patterns
in shared social practices. You are observing how social rules work, not
assessing whether people follow them “correctly.” (Interviews are
optional and not required at any level.)</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>In your submission, clearly state which level you are
attempting: “Basic,” “Proficient,” or “Advanced.”</strong> You must
complete all components of that level to earn the grade.</p>
<h2 id="rubric-assignment-components-by-level">Rubric: Assignment
Components by Level</h2>
<p><em>Note: Each level builds upon the requirements of the previous
level(s). To achieve a higher level, all requirements from lower levels
must be met.</em></p>
<h3 id="basic-300-words-not-including-appendix"><strong>Basic (300+
words, not including appendix)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Observation Sessions: One 30-minute observation</li>
<li>Visual Evidence: 2+ photographs with analytical captions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A successful Basic submission will clearly include:</strong>
- A detailed description of the physical setting - At least one
unwritten rule clearly identified (e.g., “People never sit at the
‘wrong’ table”) - At least one behavioral pattern observed more than
once during your session - At least one connection to a sociological
concept (bolded)</p>
<p><strong>Documentation Focus (address at least three of the
following):</strong> - Physical space description - Behavioral patterns
- Unspoken rules observed - Process of “unseeing” prior knowledge - How
the space shapes who belongs and who doesn’t</p>
<h3 id="proficient-400-words-not-including-appendix"><strong>Proficient
(400+ words, not including appendix)</strong></h3>
<p>Includes all Basic requirements plus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observation Sessions: Two 30-minute observations at different
times</li>
<li>Visual Evidence: 4+ photographs with detailed analysis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation Focus (address at least two of the
following):</strong> - How newcomers learn rules (who gets corrected,
who doesn’t?) - Social hierarchy patterns (who has access to what
spaces?) - Teaching/learning of customs (how are unspoken rules
enforced?) - What happens when someone violates an unspoken rule?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis Requirements:</strong> - Pattern analysis: Show how
behaviors repeat across your two observation sessions - Social hierarchy
observations: Who has status or power in this space, and how do you
know? - Analysis of how customs are taught/learned: Provide at least 2
specific examples</p>
<h3 id="advanced-600-words-not-including-appendix"><strong>Advanced
(600+ words, not including appendix)</strong></h3>
<p>Includes all Proficient requirements plus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observation Sessions: Three 30-minute observations across varying
contexts</li>
<li>Visual Evidence: 6+ photographs with comprehensive analysis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis (choose one):</strong> -
<strong>Different times of day</strong>: How do social norms,
hierarchies, and use of space differ during lunch vs. afternoon
vs. evening? - <strong>Different groups using the same space</strong>:
How do undergraduates vs. graduate students (or other groups) navigate
the same space differently? - <strong>The same practice across two
locations</strong>: How are similar activities (claiming seats, marking
territory, entering) done differently in two different campus
spaces?</p>
<p>Your analysis should explicitly show what changes and why it matters
sociologically.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Requirements:</strong> - Complex pattern analysis
showing how multiple social forces operate together - Theory
development: Does your observation support, challenge, or complicate any
concept from class? - Critical reflection: What are the limitations of
your three observation sessions? What couldn’t you see? - At least 3
course concepts explicitly connected to your findings</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A note on grading:</strong> Grades are based on the clarity
of observation, strength of evidence, and quality of sociological
analysis—not on how “interesting” or exotic your location is. A dining
hall or library is just as valuable as any other space. We’re grading
your <em>thinking</em>, not your choice of subject.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Learning Spaces</strong> "Notice how classroom dynamics

rules govern participation, and informal territories emerge through
repeated use. Who sits where, and why?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Claimed Spaces</strong> "Study how people mark and defend
their territory: A jacket draped over a library chair becomes a
temporary deed, headphones signal a desire for privacy, and friend
groups consistently gather at 'their' spot in the quad."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Signaling</strong> "Examine the subtle ways status
and belonging are displayed: Choice of study spots, preferred entrance
routes, even walking patterns can indicate social position and group
membership. Watch how different social circles navigate shared
spaces."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time Patterns</strong> "Consider how space use changes
throughout the day: The ebb and flow between classes, prime study hours
in the library, and the transformation of social spaces from morning to
night. What unspoken schedules govern campus life?"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gathering Spots</strong> "Observe the informal rules of
social spaces: How do people choose where to sit in the dining hall?
What behaviors mark someone as an insider versus a newcomer? Which
spaces serve as social hubs at different times?"</p></li>

<h2 id="what-beginners-mind-observation-looks-like">What Beginner’s Mind
Observation Looks Like</h2>
<p>Here’s a brief example of the kind of writing we’re looking for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>An outsider might be confused by why empty chairs remain
untouched while backpacks occupy them. The bag appears to function as a
proxy body, signaling ownership in the absence of a person. This is not
written in any handbook, yet students enforce it consistently: when
someone without a bag tries to take a “claimed” seat, nearby students
often gesture to the bag, sometimes even picking it up and handing it to
the backpack’s owner. The spatial rule—“a person can reserve a seat with
their belongings”—is taught and enforced through silent correction,
revealing how <strong>social norms</strong> function without explicit
instruction.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how this brief example: - Describes a behavior (empty chairs
with backpacks) - Treats it as strange/puzzling (beginner’s mind) -
Identifies the rule (seat-claiming through belongings) - Shows evidence
of enforcement (what happens when the rule is broken) - Connects to a
concept (<strong>social norms</strong>)</p>
<p>This is the level of specificity and analytical depth we’re aiming
for.</p>
