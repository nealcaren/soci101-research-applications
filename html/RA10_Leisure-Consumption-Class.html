<p>What do you do in your free time? It’s easy to think of leisure as
purely personal—you choose what you enjoy, what relaxes you, what makes
you happy. Yet sociologists recognize that leisure is intensely social.
Your leisure choices reveal and reinforce your social class position,
expose you to specific cultural capital, and signal your identity to
others. Whether you attend the opera or watch reality TV, go hiking or
visit the mall, spend money on experiences or time with free
activities—all of these choices are shaped by and reflect your class
position. This assignment asks you to track your leisure time and
analyze what it reveals about social inequality.</p>
<p>This exercise develops three essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Recognizing leisure consumption as a social rather than purely
individual practice</li>
<li>Analyzing how leisure preferences relate to social position and
cultural capital</li>
<li>Connecting everyday leisure choices to broader patterns of
distinction and inequality</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will document your leisure
activities over 3-14 days (depending on your level), recording how you
spend your free time, what activities cost money, what equipment or
access is required, and whether activities are public or private,
digital or analog, commodified or free. You’ll create a detailed
analysis table and explore how your leisure patterns reveal and
reproduce your social class position. Through careful analysis, you’ll
examine how access to certain leisure activities depends on economic and
cultural capital, and how your leisure habits connect to broader
patterns of social inequality.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>

<h2 id="rubric-assignment-components-by-level">Rubric: Assignment
Components by Level</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-project-overview"><strong>Introduction: Project
Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Define leisure as distinct from
work (but related to it) - Reflect on your own social position and
background: What class position do you occupy? How might this shape what
you notice about leisure? - Present your research question(s): How do
your leisure choices connect to social class? Which aspects will you
focus on? - Explain how digitization, commodification, or public/private
distinctions affect your leisure</p>
<h3 id="methods-data-collection-approach"><strong>Methods: Data
Collection Approach</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Explain how you determined your
own social class position and what it might mean for your research (This
is reflexivity—how does who you are shape what you find?) - Describe the
time period you tracked: - <strong>Basic:</strong> 3 days of leisure
activities - <strong>Proficient:</strong> 7 days of leisure activities -
<strong>Advanced:</strong> 14 days of leisure activities - List what you
documented: date/time, activity, location (public/private?), duration,
cost, materials/equipment needed, digital or analog, active or passive
consumption - Explain your documentation method: Did you keep a diary,
use photos, use a spreadsheet? - Note any patterns you looked for</p>
<p><strong>All levels must include:</strong> - 4-6 photographs of your
leisure spaces or activities with captions explaining what they show
about your leisure choices - Your complete leisure diary (can be in
appendix) showing all activities tracked</p>
<h3
id="findings-your-leisure-patterns-and-social-class"><strong>Findings:
Your Leisure Patterns and Social Class</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels must create:</strong> - A table analyzing your
leisure activities by: - Activity | Time Spent | Cost | Public/Private |
Digital/Analog | Commodified/Non-commodified | Equipment Needed</p>
<p><strong>Basic (250 words minimum):</strong> - Describe your overall
leisure patterns: What do you do in your free time? - Analyze at least
one of these dimensions: public vs. private leisure, digital vs. analog,
or commodified vs. non-commodified - Note which leisure activities cost
money and which are free - Identify at least one way your leisure
choices relate to your social position - Connect to one course concept
(bold it, e.g., <strong>cultural capital</strong>,
<strong>commodification</strong>, <strong>social class</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Proficient (400 words minimum):</strong> - Describe your
overall leisure patterns (frequency, duration, types of activities) -
Analyze all three dimensions: - Public vs. private leisure spaces (use
Sennett’s “decline of public life” thesis) - Digital vs. analog leisure
activities (how has technology changed your leisure?) - Commodified
vs. non-commodified leisure (which of your activities require
payment/memberships/equipment?) - Discuss the materials and equipment
required for your various leisure pursuits and what this reveals about
access and class - Reflect on how much of your “free time” is truly
leisure vs. household/family obligations - Connect findings to one or
more course concepts (bold them, e.g., <strong>cultural
capital</strong>, <strong>commodification</strong>, <strong>public
life</strong>, <strong>social stratification</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced (600 words minimum):</strong> - Comprehensive
analysis of all three leisure dimensions with examples - Analyze
patterns across the 14-day tracking period: Are certain activities more
frequent on certain days? Does leisure change based on work schedule? -
Discuss how your social class position provides or constrains access to
certain types of leisure - Examine how your leisure appears on social
media as a potential status marker (<strong>distinction</strong>) -
Reflect on how digitization affects your leisure choices and experiences
- Identify which leisure activities serve to maintain or reproduce your
social class position - Connect findings to two or more course concepts
(bold them, e.g., <strong>cultural capital</strong>,
<strong>commodification of leisure</strong>, <strong>digital
divide</strong>, <strong>social reproduction</strong>,
<strong>distinction</strong>, <strong>consumption patterns</strong>)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-theoretical-implications"><strong>Conclusion:
Theoretical Implications</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Reflect on how your leisure
choices reflect and reinforce social class distinctions - Discuss the
relationship between your work, leisure, and consumption patterns -
Analyze how digitization transforms your leisure experiences - Connect
back to broader sociological questions: What do your leisure patterns
reveal about inequality in society? - Discuss limitations: How might
your analysis differ if you were a different class position? What
wouldn’t you notice? What assumptions did you make?</p>
<p><strong>Advanced should add:</strong> - Propose how Sennett’s
“decline of public life” thesis appears in your own leisure patterns -
Discuss whether your leisure practices challenge or reinforce class
hierarchies</p>
<h3 id="appendix-supplementary-information"><strong>Appendix:
Supplementary Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should include:</strong> - Your complete leisure
diary/tracking data (dates, activities, times, costs, etc.) -
Photographs of your leisure spaces/activities with captions - Your
analysis table (Activity | Time Spent | Cost | Public/Private |
Digital/Analog | Commodified/Non-commodified | Equipment Needed)</p>

analysis or comparison across different days/contexts - Reflections on
patterns you noticed during tracking</p>
<h2 id="potential-focus-areas"><strong>Potential Focus
Areas</strong></h2>
<ul>

participation in transformed activities (hiking, swimming) that now
require specialized equipment, memberships, or entrance fees.</p></li>

digital, and how social class influences your access to digital
leisure.</p></li>

household obligations, family care, or other forms of unpaid
