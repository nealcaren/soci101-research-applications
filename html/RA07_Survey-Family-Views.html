<p>While many see family choices as purely individual, sociologists
recognize the powerful influence of cultural, economic, and historical
factors. Family formation—when and whether to have children, whom to
marry or partner with, how to structure household relationships—is
shaped by economics, social values, gender roles, religious beliefs, and
social expectations. By asking your peers about their family
aspirations, you’ll uncover patterns in how these social forces shape
intimate personal decisions.</p>
<p>This exercise develops three essential sociological research
skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Designing effective survey questions to collect meaningful data</li>
<li>Analyzing social patterns and comparing them to broader trends</li>
<li>Connecting individual attitudes and choices to larger sociological
forces</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will design and administer a survey
to peers about their views and intentions regarding family formation.
You’ll create survey questions using Microsoft Forms or Google Forms,
collect responses, analyze the patterns in your data, and compare your
findings to recent national reports on family attitudes. Through careful
question design and systematic analysis, you’ll uncover how individual
choices about family reflect broader social forces and historical
changes shaping contemporary American families.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>

<p><strong>In your submission, clearly state which level you are

<h2 id="rubric-assignment-components-by-level">Rubric: Assignment
Components by Level</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-project-overview"><strong>Introduction: Project
Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Explain what changing family
patterns are (cite the articles you read) - Present your research
question: What specific aspect of family formation are you studying?
(e.g., timing of childbearing, attitudes toward non-traditional
families, work-family balance expectations) - For Proficient/Advanced:
State your hypothesis about what factors influence family attitudes -
Connect to broader sociological issues: How do cultural, economic, or
historical factors shape family decisions?</p>
<h3 id="methods-analytical-approach"><strong>Methods: Analytical
Approach</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Describe your survey design
process: How did you develop your questions? - List all survey questions
(include exact wording) - Explain your sampling approach: How many
people did you survey? How did you recruit them? - Identify demographic
items you collected (age, gender, class, cultural background, etc.) -
Explain your data collection procedures (online form, in-person, etc.) -
Note any questions you replicated from the national surveys you read</p>
<p><strong>All levels must include:</strong> - A screenshot of your
survey (or the complete survey questions pasted in the appendix) so
graders can see exactly what you asked - Confirmation that you protected
respondent privacy: “Respondent data was anonymized (assigned numbers:
Respondent 1, Respondent 2, etc.) rather than using names”</p>
<h3 id="findings-trends-and-significance"><strong>Findings: Trends and
Significance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Basic (250 words minimum):</strong> - Report number of
respondents - Summarize key results: For 3-4 main questions, show what
percentage chose each response - Create one simple table or chart
showing results - Note at least one interesting pattern - If possible,
briefly compare to national survey data</p>
<p><strong>Proficient (400 words minimum):</strong> - Report number of
respondents and basic demographics (age range, gender distribution,
etc.) - Create a detailed results table for all major survey questions
showing: - Question | % Response 1 | % Response 2 | % Response 3 |
Student Data vs. National Data (if available) - Include a figure or
chart visualizing key findings - Compare your findings to national
survey data: How similar or different are your peers? - Analyze any
demographic patterns: Do responses vary by gender, age, or other
factors? - Explain what these patterns reveal about contemporary family
attitudes - Make clear connections to one or more course concepts (bold
them, e.g., <strong>family formation</strong>, <strong>cultural
values</strong>, <strong>social change</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced (600 words minimum):</strong> - State your
hypothesis clearly at the beginning of the findings - Report number of
respondents, detailed demographics, and response rates - Create
comprehensive results tables for all questions showing: - Question |
Student Response Options with Percentages | National Data Comparison |
Analysis - Include 2+ figures or charts visualizing patterns - Conduct
demographic analysis: How do responses differ by gender, class, age, or
cultural background? - Analyze whether your hypothesis was supported or
refuted by the data - Identify unexpected findings and explore possible
explanations - Discuss qualitative themes: Were there surprising
comments in open-ended responses? - Connect findings to two or more
course concepts (bold them, e.g., <strong>social
stratification</strong>, <strong>gender roles</strong>,
<strong>institutional factors</strong>, <strong>social change</strong>,
<strong>cohort effects</strong>)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-sociological-synthesis"><strong>Conclusion:
Sociological Synthesis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Reflect on what your survey
revealed about family attitudes in contemporary society - Explain how
individual choices about family are shaped by broader social forces -
Discuss limitations: How representative was your sample? What questions
did you not ask? What assumptions did you make? - Consider: How might
respondents’ own family backgrounds have influenced their answers?</p>
<p><strong>Advanced should add:</strong> - Propose specific
recommendations for future research: What questions would you ask
differently? Whom would you survey?</p>
<h3 id="appendix-supplementary-information"><strong>Appendix:
Supplementary Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should include:</strong> - Complete survey
instrument (screenshot or text of all questions) - Respondent data table
(anonymized with numbers, showing responses to each question)</p>
<p><strong>Proficient/Advanced should add:</strong> - Comparison
table(s) showing student data vs. national survey data (if available) -
Additional charts or visualizations - Any demographic breakdowns not
included in main text</p>
<h2 id="potential-focus-areas"><strong>Potential Focus
Areas</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Delayed Family Formation</strong> - Explore economic and
educational factors influencing timing decisions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative Family Structures</strong> - Examine
attitudes toward non-traditional family arrangements</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Work-Family Balance</strong> - Investigate expectations
about combining careers and parenting</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generational Differences</strong> - Compare attitudes

<h2 id="tips-for-effective-survey-design"><strong>Tips for Effective
Survey Design</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Keep It Focused</strong> - Limit your survey to one
specific aspect of family formation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Clear Language</strong> - Avoid jargon and ambiguous
terms</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include Demographic Items</strong> - Gather key
information to analyze subgroup differences</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Test Your Survey</strong> - Have a few friends take it
and provide feedback before full distribution</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong> - Respect privacy and
avoid overly personal questions</p></li>
</ul>
