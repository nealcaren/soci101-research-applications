<p>Who are you? More importantly, how do you define yourself? The Twenty
Statements Test (TST) is a deceptively simple but powerful research
instrument that reveals how people understand themselves and their place
in society. The TST was originally developed in the 1950s by social
psychologist Manfred Kuhn to determine the degree to which we base our
self-concepts on our membership in different groups (Kuhn and McPartland
1954). Group affiliation was a significant and prevalent quality that
defined Americans of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>In some of the earliest and most influential works using the TST,
Louis Zurcher (1977) studied the changing self-images of Americans in
the 1970s and 1980s. Zurcher found that respondents in this later group
were more likely to base their self-concept on individual traits and
independent action than group membership. These results represented a
major shift in how people defined themselves and, perhaps, society—a
shift that concerned some scholars who worried about the loss of
collective identity. What are people like now? Have things continued to
change since the 1980s? What can the TST tell us about contemporary
society and ourselves today?</p>
<p>This exercise develops two essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Analyzing how people construct identity and self-concept</li>
<li>Using systematic data collection methods to reveal patterns in how
we understand ourselves</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will complete the Twenty Statements
Test (TST) by writing twenty different responses to the question “Who am
I?” You’ll then analyze your responses using a standardized coding
scheme to identify patterns in your self-concept. Depending on your
level, you may recruit others to take the test and compare responses, or
develop your own categorization scheme. Through careful analysis, you’ll
uncover whether your self-definition is more group-based or trait-based,
role-based or individual, and what this reveals about identity in
contemporary society.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some students find the TST unsettling or
emotionally revealing. That reaction itself is sociologically
interesting and worth noting—but you are never required to share
anything you’re not comfortable analyzing or discussing in your
paper.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>

<h2 id="rubric-assignment-components-by-level">Rubric: Assignment
Components by Level</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-project-overview"><strong>Introduction: Project
Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Briefly explain what the TST
is, why it’s sociologically significant, and what research question
guides your analysis (e.g., How do I define myself? What does this
reveal about identity in contemporary society compared to earlier
generations?) - Note any specific focus (e.g., group vs. individual
identity, role-based vs. trait-based responses)</p>
<h3 id="methods-analytical-roadmap"><strong>Methods: Analytical
Roadmap</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Explain that you completed the
TST by writing twenty responses to “Who am I?” (Respond as honestly as
possible rather than aspirationally; there are no “better” or “worse”
identities for this assignment.) - Describe how you classified your
responses using the <a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3zqsvse9dbpogwt/twenty_coding.pdf?dl=1"><u>TST
coding sheet</u></a> - Explain how you counted responses in each
category - <strong>Describe how you handled any responses that were
difficult to categorize.</strong> (Which responses were ambiguous? How
did you decide where to place them?) - If conducting multiple TSTs
(Proficient/Advanced), explain how you recruited participants and
ensured anonymity: <strong>Remove all names from response sheets and
identify participants only as “Participant 1,” “Participant 2,”
etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Include in appendix:</strong> - Your completed TST response
sheet (or image of handwritten sheet) - At higher levels, images of all
response sheets (anonymized as described above)</p>
<h3 id="findings-trends-and-significance"><strong>Findings: Trends and
Significance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Present the results in a table
or figure showing the count of responses in each category - Identify
patterns in your responses (e.g., did early answers differ from later
ones? Were you more group-focused or trait-focused?) - Interpret what
these patterns might mean about your self-concept</p>
<p><strong>Basic (250 words minimum):</strong> - Summarize your coding
results - Note at least one pattern or comparison (e.g., “My first 10
responses were mostly role-based, but later responses were more
trait-based”) - Make a clear connection to one course concept (bold the
concept, e.g., <strong>socialization</strong> or
<strong>identity</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Proficient (400 words minimum):</strong> - Recruit <strong>at
least two additional participants</strong> (total N = 3, including
yourself) to complete the TST - Create a summary table or figure showing
your results and comparing across all participants - Compare your
response types from your first ~10 answers versus later answers -
Explain what this difference might reveal about how self-concept
develops - Make a clear connection to one or more course concepts (bold
them)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced (700 words minimum):</strong> - Recruit <strong>at
least four additional participants</strong> (total N = 5, including
yourself) to complete the TST - Create a summary table or figure showing
results for all participants - Develop and clearly explain your own
<strong>conceptually justified categorization scheme</strong> for the
responses (beyond the standard TST coding) - <strong>Create a second
table comparing your coding results to the standard TST
scoring.</strong> Show how responses were classified differently and
what insights your scheme reveals - Discuss what patterns emerge across
all participants, not just yourself - Make clear connections to two or
more course concepts (bold them)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-sociological-synthesis"><strong>Conclusion:
Sociological Synthesis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Reflect on what your analysis
reveals about self-concept in contemporary society - Connect your
findings back to Zurcher’s research and the shift from group-based to
individual-trait-based identity - Discuss limitations: Are there biases
in how you categorized your own responses? Would others have categorized
them differently? What assumptions did you make?</p>
<h3 id="appendix-supplementary-information"><strong>Appendix:
Supplementary Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should include:</strong> - Your completed TST
response sheet (or image of original) - Your coded responses (showing
which category each statement falls into)</p>
<p><strong>Proficient should add:</strong> - Images of all response
sheets (anonymized as described in Methods)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced should add:</strong> - Images of all response sheets
(anonymized as described in Methods) - Your custom coding scheme
documentation - Both the standard and custom coding tables</p>
