<p>Women’s representation in media is a fundamental indicator of how
society values women’s voices, stories, and autonomy. Yet how do we
measure something as complex as gender bias in popular culture? The
Bechdel Test offers one simple but revealing metric: Does the show have
two female characters who talk to each other about something other than
a man? It’s a deceptively simple question—yet the majority of films and
television shows fail it. This assignment asks you to apply standardized
measurement tools to examine gender representation on screen and to
think critically about both what these tests reveal and what they might
miss.</p>
<p>This exercise develops three essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Applying systematic measurement methods to analyze culture</li>
<li>Examining how gender inequality appears in media representation</li>
<li>Thinking critically about the limitations of measurement tools and
the complexity of social phenomena</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will watch and analyze television
episodes using the Bechdel Test and at least one additional
gender-focused measurement tool. You’ll examine how women are
represented on screen, which characters have agency and voice, and what
patterns emerge across episodes and genres. By using standardized tests,
you’ll learn how sociologists operationalize abstract concepts like
“gender bias” and “representation.” You’ll also develop your own test
(if pursuing Advanced level) to measure dimensions the Bechdel Test
misses.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>
<p><strong>Before you begin:</strong> - Watch [<a

discuss the Bechdel Test</a> - Read Walt Hickey, Ella Koeze, Rachael
Dottle, and Gus Wezerek’s [<a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250306130523/https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/">The
next Bechdel Test</a> - Before watching, predict whether each episode
will pass the Bechdel test and your (or another) test - While watching,
take detailed notes on anything meaningful you observe related to gender
representation</p>

<p><strong>In your submission, clearly state which level you are

<h2 id="rubric-assignment-components-by-level">Rubric: Assignment
Components by Level</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-project-overview"><strong>Introduction: Project
Overview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Explain what the Bechdel Test
measures and why it matters sociologically - Describe which test(s) you
will use (Bechdel and one other for Basic/Proficient; Bechdel and your
custom test for Advanced) - Note your predictions: Before watching,
which episodes do you expect to pass? Why? - Explain your research
question (e.g., “Which genres pass the Bechdel Test more often?” or “Do
shows with women directors have different gender representation?”)</p>
<h3 id="methods-analytical-roadmap"><strong>Methods: Analytical
Roadmap</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Name the television shows and
specific episodes you analyzed (include air dates) - Explain the Bechdel
Test criteria clearly - Describe the second test you used: -
<strong>Basic/Proficient:</strong> Identify which test from [<a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250306130523/https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/">The
next Bechdel Test</a> you chose and explain its criteria -
<strong>Advanced:</strong> Clearly explain your custom-designed test,
including: the criteria, the outcome scale (pass/fail, letter grades,
numeric 0-100), and what each outcome value represents - Describe your
note-taking approach: What observations did you record while
watching?</p>
<p><strong>All levels should include:</strong> - Screenshots from
episodes you analyzed (showing female characters, interactions, etc.) to
support your findings - Your detailed screening notes for all episodes
(can be in appendix)</p>
<h3 id="findings-trends-and-significance"><strong>Findings: Trends and
Significance</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels must include:</strong> - A data table showing:
Episode | Show | Passes Bechdel? | Passes [Your Test]? | Notes - For
each episode analyzed, include a screenshot with a caption explaining
what it shows about gender representation</p>
<p><strong>Basic (250 words minimum):</strong> - Summarize results: How
many episodes passed/failed each test? - Note at least one pattern
(e.g., “Comedies passed more often than dramas”) - Analyze what
surprised you or was unexpected</p>
<p><strong>Proficient (500 words minimum):</strong> - Create a detailed
results table for 4+ episodes - Compare results across episodes: What
patterns emerge? Do certain genres pass more often? - Analyze whether
your initial predictions were accurate - Explain what these patterns
reveal about gender representation in television - Connect findings to
more than one course concept (bold them, e.g., <strong>gender
roles</strong>, <strong>stereotypes</strong>,
<strong>representation</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced (750 words minimum):</strong> - State your
hypothesis clearly at the beginning of the findings section - Create a
comprehensive results table for 4+ episodes showing both Bechdel and
your custom test scores - Analyze whether the data supports or refutes
your hypothesis - Discuss patterns and exceptions: Which episodes or
genres performed unexpectedly? - Examine how the two tests reveal
different or similar insights about gender representation - Include
detailed analysis of how your test captures dimensions the Bechdel Test
misses - Connect findings to two or more course concepts (bold them,
e.g., <strong>intersectionality</strong>, <strong>gender
stratification</strong>, <strong>media representation</strong>,
<strong>stereotyping</strong>)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-sociological-synthesis"><strong>Conclusion:
Sociological Synthesis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should:</strong> - Reflect on what your analysis
reveals about gender in media - Discuss limitations: What do these tests
measure well? What do they miss? Could intersectionality (race, class,
sexuality, disability) affect how we interpret results? - Consider: How
might audience interpretation of gender representations vary based on
viewers’ own social positions? - Connect back to broader sociological
questions about how media shapes or reflects gender inequality</p>
<p><strong>Advanced should add:</strong> - Discuss your custom test:
Does it better capture gender bias than the Bechdel Test? Why or why
not? - Consider methodological questions: Are these reductive measures?
What complexity do they lose?</p>
<h3 id="appendix-supplementary-information"><strong>Appendix:
Supplementary Information</strong></h3>
<p><strong>All levels should include:</strong> - Your detailed screening
notes for all episodes analyzed - Screenshots from each episode with
captions - Your results table(s)</p>
<p><strong>Advanced should add:</strong> - Your custom test criteria
documentation (clearly written definitions) - Any additional analysis or
comparison tables</p>
