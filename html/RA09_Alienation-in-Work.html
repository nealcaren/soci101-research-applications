<p>Many students work—campus jobs, service jobs, or gig work like
DoorDash. It can feel straightforward: you do tasks, you get paid.
Sociologists ask a deeper question: <strong>how do the structures of
work shape what the job feels like?</strong> Do you have control over
how you work? Do you feel connected to what you produce? Do you feel
like yourself while doing it?</p>
<p>Karl Marx called these disconnects <strong>alienation</strong>—when
workers lose connection to their labor, to other people, or to
themselves. In this research application, you’ll use an interview to
examine whether and how alienation shows up in contemporary student
work.</p>
<p>This exercise develops three essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Understanding how work structures shape workers’ experiences and
identities</li>
<li>Applying Marxist concepts to analyze contemporary capitalism</li>
<li>Recognizing how social forces (not individual personality) explain
workplace experiences</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will conduct one semi-structured
interview (20-30 minutes) with a peer who works: a campus job, a service
job, a gig/platform job, or treats school as their “work.” Using an
interview protocol focused on Marx’s concept of alienation, you’ll ask
about their experience across four dimensions: alienation from the
product (what they create), from the process (control over how they
work), from others (relationships at work), and from self (whether work
reflects their identity). Through careful analysis of their responses,
you’ll explore how job structure—not personality—shapes whether and how
workers experience alienation in contemporary capitalism.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>
<p><strong>Before you begin:</strong> - Review Chapter 11’s discussion
of <strong>Marx, capitalism, and alienation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ethics and confidentiality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> record audio or video</li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> collect real names in your notes or
paper</li>
<li>Your interviewee may skip any question or stop the interview at any
time</li>
<li>Avoid sensitive topics (illegal activity, harassment, medical
information). If something sensitive comes up, do not probe—move on to
the next question</li>
</ul>

Components by Level</h2>
<h3 id="basic-250-words-minimum"><strong>Basic (250 words
minimum)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Introduction: Project Overview</strong> - Explain what
alienation means (Marx’s concept) - Identify the worker you interviewed
and their job type - Present your research question: Which forms of
alienation shape this person’s work experience?</p>
<p><strong>Methods: Analytical Roadmap</strong> - Describe the worker
(job type, hours, context) without using their real name - Explain your
interview approach: How did you conduct it? Where? How long? - List the
four alienation domains you explored - Note: “I took detailed notes
during/immediately after the interview. Interview notes are included in
appendix, anonymized with job title only (e.g., ‘Campus Job
Worker’)”</p>
<p><strong>Findings: Trends and Significance</strong> - Identify
<strong>at least two forms of alienation</strong> present in this
person’s work - Provide specific quotes or examples from the interview -
Explain which alienation dimension is strongest and why - When
explaining patterns, focus on <strong>job features</strong> (scripting,
monitoring, customer power, schedule control, pay uncertainty), not
traits (shy, lazy, anxious) - Connect to <strong>at least one course
concept</strong> (bold it, e.g., <strong>alienation</strong>,
<strong>bureaucracy</strong>, <strong>capitalism</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Sociological Synthesis</strong> - Reflect on how
job structure (not personality) explains the patterns you found -
Discuss limitations: What didn’t you ask? How might this person’s
background shape their answers? What would you do differently?</p>
<p><strong>Appendix</strong> - Your interview notes (bullet points are
fine) or short transcript-style summary (not verbatim required) - The
question list you used, with any follow-ups you added</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="proficient-400-words-minimum"><strong>Proficient (400 words
minimum)</strong></h3>
<p>Includes all Basic requirements plus:</p>
<p><strong>Methods: Analytical Roadmap</strong> - Provide more detail on
job context: pay, hours, degree of monitoring/control,
customer/supervisor interaction - Explain how you ensured
confidentiality in your notes</p>
<p><strong>Findings: Trends and Significance</strong> - Analyze
<strong>all four alienation dimensions</strong>: - Alienation from
product: Does this person feel connection to what they produce? -
Alienation from process: How much control do they have over how they
work? - Alienation from others: How do relationships at work operate
(cooperation vs. competition)? - Alienation from self: Does this work
reflect their identity? - For each dimension, explain whether it’s
present and how strong - Provide <strong>3+ specific examples or
quotes</strong> from the interview - When explaining patterns, focus on
<strong>job features</strong> (scripting, monitoring, customer power,
schedule control, pay uncertainty), not traits - Connect to <strong>two
course concepts</strong> (bold them, e.g., <strong>alienation</strong>,
<strong>service work</strong>, <strong>gig economy</strong>,
<strong>labor</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Sociological Synthesis</strong> - Explain how
<strong>job structure</strong> (scripting, monitoring, compensation,
relationship to product) creates alienation - Discuss whether
<strong>resistance</strong> appears: Does the worker joke, bend rules,
or disengage to cope? - Reflect on limitations: How might your
relationship to this person (peer, friend) have shaped their answers?
What aspects of alienation might they have held back? What would you do
differently?</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="advanced-600-words-minimum"><strong>Advanced (600 words
minimum)</strong></h3>
<p>Includes all Proficient requirements plus:</p>
<p><strong>Research Design Enhancement</strong> - Develop and state a
specific <strong>hypothesis</strong> before analyzing your data. Example
hypotheses: - “Workers with less control over their process experience
stronger alienation from self” - “Service work creates stronger
alienation from the product than campus work” - “Gig workers feel
alienated from others more than campus workers do”</p>
<p><strong>Findings: Trends and Significance</strong> - Analyze all four
alienation dimensions with nuance - Include <strong>5+ specific
examples/quotes</strong> - Add <strong>one comparison</strong> (choose
one): 1. <strong>Prediction vs. findings:</strong> Does your data
support or contradict your hypothesis? Explain 2. <strong>Marx’s era
vs. today:</strong> What would Marx notice about contemporary
student/service work? What would surprise him about this person’s
experience? 3. <strong>Job-type contrast:</strong> Compare your
interviewee’s alienation to how you think peers in different job types
(campus vs. service vs. gig) experience alienation - Connect to
<strong>three course concepts</strong> (bold them)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Sociological Synthesis</strong> - If you made a
comparison: Evaluate it. Was your hypothesis supported? Complicated?
Contradicted? - Analyze <strong>resistance strategies</strong> in
detail: How does this worker actively or passively resist alienation
(humor, rule-bending, disengagement, seeking meaning)? - Reflect deeply
on limitations: How does <strong>your own position</strong> (student,
class background, work experience) shape what you noticed or what your
interviewee shared? What biases might you have brought to the
interview?</p>
<p><strong>Appendix</strong> - Interview notes (bullet points are fine)
or short transcript-style summary - The question list you used with
follow-ups - Brief analysis of your hypothesis (if applicable)</p>
