<p>This assignment examines how television shows represent social class
through Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of cultural capital—the knowledge,
behaviors, and assets that shape social mobility. You’ll analyze
characters from different class backgrounds across multiple episodes,
examining how their speech patterns, possessions, and credentials
reflect and reinforce class distinctions.</p>
<p>Television provides a unique lens for studying cultural capital:
while it may exaggerate obvious class markers like clothing and homes
for dramatic effect, it often understates subtler distinctions that
shape real social mobility, like micro-behaviors and cultural
references. TV characters can also navigate class boundaries more
fluidly than real people, sometimes oversimplifying how deeply ingrained
cultural capital affects social advancement. By critically analyzing
these portrayals, you develop a sharper understanding of both media
representation and real-world class dynamics.</p>
<p>This exercise develops three essential sociological skills:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Analyzing how media represents social class and inequality</li>
<li>Identifying cultural capital in its three forms (embodied,
objectified, institutionalized)</li>
<li>Connecting media representations to broader theories of social
reproduction</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>In this research application, you will select a television show
featuring characters from different social class positions and analyze
how they display different forms of cultural capital. You’ll examine how
characters’ speech patterns, manners, possessions, leisure activities,
credentials, and social networks signal their class position. Through
careful observation across multiple episodes, you’ll uncover how the
show represents—or misrepresents—social class and cultural
inequality.</p>
<p>The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on
what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or
Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily
complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and
resubmit their application.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-framework-to-apply"><strong>Theoretical Framework to
Apply:</strong></h3>
<p>Cultural capital, as theorized by Pierre Bourdieu (1973, 1984),
refers to the knowledge, skills, behaviors, and cultural assets that
individuals inherit and develop, which influence their social mobility.
It plays a crucial role in <em>social reproduction</em>, the process by
which social class is maintained across generations.</p>
<p>Cultural capital exists in three forms, each shaping how individuals
navigate social life and are perceived by others.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Embodied cultural capital</strong> includes deeply
ingrained habits, mannerisms, and linguistic styles that are developed
over time through socialization. These traits, such as an eloquent way
of speaking, refined table manners, or confidence in elite social
settings, often signal a person’s upbringing and class
background.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objectified cultural capital</strong> refers to material
possessions that hold cultural value, such as books, artwork, musical
instruments, or designer clothing. These objects not only reflect an
individual's cultural knowledge but also require an understanding of
their meaning and significance to be fully appreciated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Institutionalized cultural capital</strong> is formal
recognition of cultural competencies, such as academic degrees,
professional certifications, or prestigious awards, which serve as
credentials that grant social legitimacy and access to higher-status
opportunities. In television narratives, these forms of cultural capital
can be observed in how characters speak, what they own, and the
credentials they use to navigate their worlds, influencing their social
mobility, relationships, and the way others perceive them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Children from privileged backgrounds gain advantages through exposure
to high-status cultural norms, shaping their educational success and
career prospects. It also affects how others perceive and evaluate
individuals, such as in job interviews, where familiarity with elite
social cues can provide an edge. While some attempt to acquire cultural
capital later in life—through education, travel, or social
networking—deeply ingrained class markers like accent and mannerisms
often persist, reinforcing social hierarchies.</p>

<li><p><strong>Cultural Capital Analysis:</strong> Track specific
markers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Embodied Cultural Capital</strong> (habits, manners,
language)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Language use:</strong> Consider how the character
speaks—does their vocabulary, accent, or use of slang reflect a
particular social background or class position?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manners and etiquette:</strong> How does the character
behave in social settings? Do they display confidence, politeness, or
discomfort in high-status environments?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Food and dining preferences:</strong> Does the character
exhibit knowledge of fine dining, gourmet cooking, or wine pairings, or
do they prefer fast food or casual dining?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Objectified Cultural Capital</strong> (material
possessions and cultural goods)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Leisure activities and hobbies:</strong> What pastimes
does the character engage in? Are they involved in activities typically
associated with wealth and status (e.g., golf, ballet, international
travel) or more working-class pursuits (e.g., barbecuing, bowling, video
gaming)?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cultural consumption:</strong> What kinds of music, art,
or literature does the character enjoy? Do they attend museums, read
classic novels, or listen to opera, or do they prefer pop culture and
mainstream entertainment?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fashion choices and brand preferences:</strong> Does the
character wear designer labels, business attire, or casual clothes? Do
their fashion choices signal wealth, professionalism, or rebellion
against social norms?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical spaces and living environments:</strong> Where
does the character live? Is it a luxury apartment, suburban home, or
shared space in a lower-income neighborhood? What decorations or
possessions suggest their cultural capital?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Institutionalized Cultural Capital</strong> (formal
credentials and social legitimacy)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Educational background and attitudes:</strong> What level
of education has the character attained? Do they reference prestigious
universities, technical training, or a lack of formal education? How do
they value education in their personal or professional life?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social networks and relationships:</strong> Who does the
character associate with? Are they connected to influential or elite
social circles, or do they primarily interact with people from a similar
or marginalized background? How do their relationships reinforce or
challenge their cultural capital?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>By organizing your analysis around these three forms of cultural
capital, consider how the character's background, behaviors, and
possessions influence their social mobility, relationships, and
opportunities within the show's narrative.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Critical Analysis:</strong> Things to think about?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How stereotypes and biases shape character portrayals</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the show challenges or reinforces class
hierarchies</p></li>
<li><p>How intersectionality affects character depictions (race, gender,
sexuality)</p></li>
<li><p>The economic and social implications of these
representations</p></li>
<li><p>The show's overall commentary on class mobility and
inequality</p></li>

<h3 id="conclusion-guidance"><strong>Conclusion Guidance</strong></h3>
<p>All levels should: - Reflect on what your analysis reveals about how
media represents social class and cultural capital - Discuss the
limitations of your analysis: Does the show oversimplify class? What
aspects of cultural capital does it miss? How might a character’s race,
gender, or other identities affect how cultural capital appears? -
Consider: How might different viewers (from different class positions)
interpret the same scenes differently? - Connect your findings back to
Bourdieu’s concept and to broader questions about social reproduction
and inequality</p>
<h3 id="additional-notes"><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider how production elements (cinematography, music, set
design) reinforce class distinctions</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze how character development may challenge or reinforce
class expectations</p></li>
<li><p>Examine how audience reception might vary based on viewers’ class
positions</p></li>
