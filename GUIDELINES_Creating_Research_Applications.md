# Guidelines for Creating SOCI 101 Research Applications

These guidelines ensure that all research applications maintain consistent quality, clarity, and pedagogical rigor across the course.

---

## 1. OPENING STRUCTURE (No Headers Yet)

Every RA must begin with three elements **without headers**:

### A. Opening Narrative (3-4 sentences)
- Start with an engaging hook: a question, observation, or scenario that connects to student life
- Explain why this topic matters sociologically (reveal the social forces behind something students think is individual/natural)
- Establish the intellectual tension (e.g., "It seems individual, but it's actually social")
- Transition into the assignment concept

**Example opening:**
"Women's representation in media is a fundamental indicator of how society values women's voices, stories, and autonomy. Yet how do we measure something as complex as gender bias in popular culture? The Bechdel Test offers one simple but revealing metric..."

### B. Skills Section
Use this exact format:

"This exercise develops [NUMBER] essential sociological skill[s]:

1. [First skill—specific, action-oriented]
2. [Second skill]
3. [Third skill (if applicable)]"

**Skills should:**
- Be specific and measurable (not "learn about media")
- Use action verbs (analyzing, recognizing, connecting, identifying)
- Connect to course learning outcomes
- Be 2-4 skills maximum

**Example:**
"This exercise develops three essential sociological skills:

1. Applying systematic measurement methods to analyze culture
2. Examining how gender inequality appears in media representation
3. Thinking critically about the limitations of measurement tools"

### C. Assignment Overview Section (## Assignment Overview header)

After skills, include **## Assignment Overview** header followed by:

**Paragraph 1:** Clear description of what students will DO
- "In this research application, you will..."
- Explain the core activity/method
- Describe what they'll produce/analyze
- How long/scope (e.g., "4 episodes," "7 days," "3-5 interviews")

**Paragraph 2:** Connect to sociology
- How this connects to course concepts
- Why this method teaches sociological thinking
- What students will discover about social forces

**Paragraph 3:** Grading/Requirements statement
"The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and resubmit their application."

**Example:**
"In this research application, you will watch and analyze television episodes using the Bechdel Test and at least one additional gender-focused measurement tool. You'll examine how women are represented on screen, which characters have agency and voice, and what patterns emerge across episodes and genres. By using standardized tests, you'll learn how sociologists operationalize abstract concepts like 'gender bias' and 'representation.' You'll also develop your own test (if pursuing Advanced level) to measure dimensions the Bechdel Test misses.

The specific requirements for what you need to do vary depending on what grade you would like to earn: Basic (75), Proficient (87), or Advanced (100). Students who come close but do not satisfactorily complete the requirements for a level will be allowed to revise and resubmit their application."

---

## 2. PRE-ASSIGNMENT MATERIALS (if applicable)

If students need to read articles, watch videos, or prepare materials, include:

**Format:**
"Before you begin:
- [Required reading/viewing with link]
- [Required reading/viewing with link]
- [Any preparation or prediction tasks]"

**Keep to essentials only.** Don't overload with materials.

---

## 3. REPORT STRUCTURE SECTION

Include this header and text exactly:

"## Report Structure

Use the standard [[research report template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B8HbIVuqB8v81gK4dcgdhSHgu96nNl565554oqEcU0I/edit?usp=sharing)]. Below are the specific requirements for each section:

---

**In your submission, clearly state which level you are attempting: "Basic," "Proficient," or "Advanced."** You must complete all components of that level to earn the grade."

**Always include the clarity statement.** This is critical.

---

## 4. RUBRIC STRUCTURE

### Format Requirements
- **Use lists, not tables**
- **All levels must be clear and visually distinct**
- Level headers must include word count: ### **Basic (250 words)**, ### **Proficient (400 words)**, ### **Advanced (600 words)**

### Structure Within Each Level

For each level, organize by **REPORT SECTION** (not by component type):

```
### **Basic (250 words minimum)**

**Introduction: Project Overview**
- What should students include?
- Bulleted list of elements

**Methods: Analytical Roadmap**
- How did you collect data?
- Bulleted list of specific requirements

**Findings: Trends and Significance**
- What should you present?
- How many examples/pages?

**Conclusion: Sociological Synthesis**
- What reflection is required?
- How connect to course concepts?

**Appendix**
- What raw data/evidence to include?
```

### Escalation Language
Use this pattern:

- **Basic:** [specific requirements]
- **Proficient:** "Includes all Basic requirements plus: [new/enhanced requirements]"
- **Advanced:** "Includes all Proficient requirements plus: [new/enhanced requirements]"

This makes clear that each level builds on previous levels.

---

## 5. MANDATORY ELEMENTS ACROSS ALL RAs

### A. Course Concept Guidance
In the appropriate section (usually Findings/Discussion), include language like:

"Connect your findings to [NUMBER] course concept[s]. Bold specific concepts (e.g., **socialization**, **deviance**, **cultural capital**)"

**Provide 3-5 examples** of concepts students might use. Make it easy for them to know what to bold.

### B. Evidence Requirements
Explicitly state in Methods/Findings:

"Include evidence documenting your [data collection/observations] such as:
- Photographs/screenshots [with captions explaining what they show]
- [Method-specific examples: interview transcripts, field notes, tables, etc.]
- Your [diary/notes/survey] in appendix"

**All RAs must require SOME form of evidence** to prevent purely LLM-generated work.

### C. Limitations Discussion
In Conclusion section, explicitly ask:

"Discuss limitations:
- What are the weaknesses of your method?
- What important questions couldn't you answer?
- What biases might have shaped your findings?
- How might your [identity/position] have affected what you noticed?"

**Make limitations requirement explicit.** Don't assume students will add it.

### D. Appendix Requirements
Always specify what goes in appendix:
- Raw data (field notes, survey responses, screenshots, etc.)
- Tables/figures referenced in main text
- [Method-specific items: interview transcripts, photos, coding schemes, etc.]

---

## 6. RESEARCH METHOD CONSIDERATIONS

### When to Use Each Method:

**Ethnographic Observation (30-45 minute sessions)**
- Good for: Understanding norms, routines, hierarchies, social interaction
- Escalation: 1 session → 2 sessions → 3 sessions at different times/contexts
- Examples: Beginner's Mind, Organizational Rules

**Media Analysis (content analysis, coding)**
- Good for: Representation, stereotypes, how culture reflects/creates inequality
- Escalation: 2-3 examples → 4+ examples → custom analysis scheme
- Examples: Bechdel Test, Cultural Capital on TV

**Interviews (1-40 minutes)**
- Good for: Lived experience, how people understand their lives, subjective meaning
- Escalation: 1 interview → 2-3 interviews → 3+ diverse interviews with hypothesis testing
- Examples: Work/Labor, Health Information & Trust
- **Must include ethics guidance:** anonymization, confidentiality, sensitive topics

**Diary/Tracking (time-based)**
- Good for: Personal habits, revealing what's invisible/taken-for-granted
- Escalation: 4 hours → 6 hours → 24 hours (or 3 days → 7 days → 14 days)
- Examples: Media Consumption, Leisure Consumption
- Must include specific tracking instructions

**Survey Research**
- Good for: Patterns across populations, comparing to national data
- Escalation: 15 responses → 20+ responses → hypothesis testing/demographic analysis
- Examples: Family Views
- Must include: survey design guidance, sampling approach, ethics

## 7. WORD COUNTS & ESCALATION

### Standard Word Counts
- **Basic:** 250 words minimum (not counting appendix)
- **Proficient:** 400 words minimum
- **Advanced:** 600 words minimum

These are defaults. Adjust if the method demands different scope.

### Escalation Should Always Include
1. **More data collection** (more sessions, more interviews, longer tracking, more examples)
2. **Deeper analysis** (more nuance, hypothesis testing, theoretical comparison, demographic breakdown)
3. **Methodological sophistication** (custom coding schemes, reflexivity, limitations, comparative approaches)
4. **Broader theory connection** (more course concepts, explicit theory application)

Never escalate by just asking for more of the same repetitive description. Escalate cognitively.

---

## 8. ACCESSIBILITY & EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Questions to Ask When Designing an RA:

- **Does this require special resources?** (Can a low-income student do it? Internet access? Tech?)
- **Does this assume certain background/experiences?** (Family structure? Leisure time? Health? Cultural knowledge?)
- **Can this be done remotely/digitally if needed?**
- **Are there multiple valid approaches?** (e.g., can they choose their own TV show, organization, interview subject?)
- **Does the assignment center marginalized voices** or only privileged ones?

### Language to Include:
"You can [alternative approach]. Students should feel empowered to choose a context that works for their situation."

**Example:** "You can observe a campus space OR a digital community space you participate in."

---

## 9. ETHICAL GUIDELINES (for any RA involving people)

If interviews, observation of people, or surveys are involved:

### Required Language in Methods:

"**Ethical Considerations:**
- Protect privacy: [specific guidance on anonymization]
- [Method-specific ethics: informed consent, sensitivity, right to decline, etc.]
- If [sensitive topic] emerges, [what to do]"

### For Interviews Specifically:
"Your research is not formally approved by IRB (not required for class research), but you should:
- Ask permission before recording
- Offer anonymity (use codes like 'Respondent 1' not names)
- Don't ask overly personal questions
- Respect if someone declines to answer
- Keep responses private"

### For Observation:
"Respect privacy of those you observe:
- Don't use real names in your report
- Don't record people without consent (if applicable)
- If someone asks you to stop observing them, do so
- Don't observe in private spaces"

---

## 10. INTEGRATION WITH COURSE SCHEDULE

When adding new RAs:

- **Assign it after** relevant chapters/topics are covered (don't do Breaching Experiment before Deviance chapter)
- **Space them out** across the semester (not all at once)
- **Distribute methods** so students experience variety
- **Consider final exam timing** (don't assign major ones right before)

---

## 11. TEMPLATE CHECKLIST

When creating a new RA, verify it includes:

**Opening:**
- [ ] Engaging opening narrative (no header)
- [ ] Skills section (numbered list, 2-4 skills)

## 12. EXAMPLES OF STRONG RAs

Refer to these as models:
- **RA #2 (Twenty Statements):** Strong escalation of analysis sophistication
- **RA #3 (Breaching):** Excellent ethics guidance and limitations discussion
- **RA #5 (Bechdel):** Clear connection between measurement and sociological concepts
- **RA #6 (Family Survey):** Good balance of clear instructions and student autonomy
- **RA #8 (Leisure):** Excellent reflexivity guidance

---

## Questions to Discuss Before Creating a New RA:

1. What sociological concept does this teach?
2. What research method is most appropriate?
3. Who are the students doing this (what are their circumstances)?
4. How does this fit into the semester schedule?
5. What evidence will prove they actually did the work?
6. What would make this accessible to all students?
7. How does this connect to course themes and other RAs?
